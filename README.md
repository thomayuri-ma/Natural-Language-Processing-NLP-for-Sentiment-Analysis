# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-for-Sentiment-Analysis

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using a dataset of movie reviews. The data is preprocessed through tokenization and stopword removal to prepare it for analysis. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is utilized to predict sentiments as either positive or negative, achieving a satisfactory accuracy score. The project includes visualizations, such as a Word Cloud highlighting common words and a confusion matrix for model evaluation. The trained model and vectorizer are saved for potential deployment in real-time sentiment analysis applications, such as product reviews or social media sentiment tracking.
